## How to use

### Place the panel

By default the panel will be on the right side of the screen, this can be adjusted by:

- `View > Change application layout`
- Use the arrow keys (the displayed ones, not keyboard keys) to move the panel at the desired position
- Move the splitter to reach the desired height/width of the panel
- Press `ESC` to save the layout and return to normal mode

### Add favorite

- To add a new favorite to the panel, you have to trigger the appropriate [command](#commands)
  - In the table you can see also from which menu context the commands can be triggered
- Notebooks, notes and to-dos can also be added via drag & drop the selected entries onto the `FAVORITES` title of the panel
  - To enable this feature, the option `Show favorites panel title` must be enabled

The `Edit favorite before add` option lets you choose whether or not to edit the name before adding a new favorite.

- This is not supported when adding multiple selected notes
- For searches the dialog is always opened to enter the search query

For searches, you can also edit the search query.

### Remove favorite

- Right click on one of the favorites to open the edit dialog (see screenshots above)
- Press `Delete` to remove the favorite

Alternatively you can remove all favorites at once via the `Favorites: Remove all favorites` command.

### Open saved search

Currently favorites for searches are not fully supported. Due to restrictions of the App it is not possible to open the global search with a handled search query.
To open a saved search follow this workaround:

- Save your search via the `Favorites: Add search` command
- You can enter a name and the search query in the dialog
- Click on the search favorite to copy its query to the clipboard
- This will also set the focus to the global search bar
- Paste the clipboard content to the search bar and press `Enter`

## Commands

This plugin provides additional commands as described in the following table.

Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned in user options via `Tools > Options > Keyboard Shortcuts` to all commands which are assigned to the `Tools>Favorites` menu context.
Search for the command label where shortcuts shall be added.
